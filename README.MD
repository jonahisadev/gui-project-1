# Draw Shapes

This is my project for CSC 344 - GUI Application Design. The project
utilizes many of the things we learned in chapters 2-7. The app
allows a user to input points into a table, and a polygon will be
drawn to the right.

**NOTE:** This project was built with Java 13, so it may not run on
your computer. I will show it to you anytime we're both available.
